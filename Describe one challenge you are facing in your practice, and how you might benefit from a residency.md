The creation of work requires patience. The ideas incubate and emerge slowly, but with the velocity of present economic scheme it often becomes difficult to carve out the moments and means for the production of these works. I, like quantum physics, experience space and time as intertwined, and balancing them is necessary and challenging. Squeezing artistic output into silvers of time keenly restrains the work that can be made. Escaping this quagmire would require momentarily suspending these forces and sequestering the studio. ACRE would provide this. While the facilities, like screen-printing and wood shops, enable a fertile and productive occasion to realize many of the projects ideated over the last year. Having the space and time for the development of work while surrounded by a critical and engaged group of artists will enable the fruitful creation I have been gestating.
