I investigate systems through their physical manifestations. The work is made from common materials like plywood, newsprint, and drywall, to evoke context rather than visual allure. Beginning from disconnections noticed in institutions and relationships, the work takes form as objects and performances that bridge or point to the observed gaps. These works shift from a hand-built billboard and a Walmart reproduction of a hand crafted tapestry to disparate actions including a baptism in a fountain and a protest with out words. Yet, the work is consistent in its goal of producing poetic material dsiruptions of our social systems.  thanks.
